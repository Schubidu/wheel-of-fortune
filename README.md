# Wheel of Fortune
Did you ever wanted to elect a winner through a raffle and needed a quick an simple app for that? This is one of them. A simple and lightweight angular app doing this very single thing.

## How does it work?
In a simple CRUD list you manage the participants for the raffle. Then you turn the wheel and elect a winner, the winners are stored on the winner page. Both the winners and participants are stored in localstorage at the moment.

For screenshots see [Screenshots](#screenshots).
