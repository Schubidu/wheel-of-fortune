{"name":"Wheel of fortune","tagline":"","body":"# Wheel of Fortune\r\nDid you ever wanted to elect a winner through a raffle and needed a quick an simple app for that? This is one of them. A simple and lightweight angular app doing this very single thing.\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\nIn a simple CRUD list you manage the participants for the raffle. Each participant has an amount of spokes in the wheel, which can be seen as a winning chance. Then you turn the wheel and elect a winner, the winners are stored on the winner page. Both the winners and participants are stored in localstorage at the moment.\r\n\r\nFor screenshots see [Screenshots](#screenshots).\r\n\r\nThe size of a single participant's slice is calculated as `(360 / (total number of spokes)) * number of spokes`.\r\n\r\nTo start the election, slide the wheel or press the Go button. [Hammer.JS](http://hammerjs.github.io/) is used to handle the pan event and by is mobile friendly by  that. If using slide, the rotation is based on the distance on the X Axis, if pressing the Go button, a random integer between 0 and 360 is used to base the distance calculation on. For random integers, [chance.js](http://chancejs.com/) is used.\r\n\r\n## Setup & Run\r\nUse `git clone`, `npm install` or download the tarball from github to install it. Here, git clone will be used.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/finanzcheck/wheel-of-fortune.git\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3001`.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Wheel\r\n![Wheel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finanzcheck/wheel-of-fortune/gh-pages/docs/screenshots/wheel.png)\r\n\r\n### Wheel Hover\r\n![Wheel Hover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finanzcheck/wheel-of-fortune/gh-pages/docs/screenshots/wheel_hover.png)\r\n\r\n### Participants list\r\n![Participants](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finanzcheck/wheel-of-fortune/gh-pages/docs/screenshots/participants.png)\r\n\r\n### Winners list\r\n![Winners](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finanzcheck/wheel-of-fortune/gh-pages/docs/screenshots/winners.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
